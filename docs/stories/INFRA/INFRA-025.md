title: Add formal containment check to era_new.py path construction (CER-011)
status: complete
phase: ""
primary_files:
  - skills/pairmode/scripts/era_new.py
touches: []
---

## Acceptance criterion

`era_new.py` uses `resolve().relative_to(project_dir.resolve())` as a formal containment
check on the era file destination path, in addition to the existing `_slugify()` cleanse.
Test asserts containment failure raises ValueError on a crafted name.

## Background (CER-011)

Source: Security audit cp18 (2026-04-30). Severity: LOW. `_slugify()` neutralises "/" and
"." in `--name` before path construction, providing effective but informal traversal
prevention. No formal `resolve().relative_to()` containment check present.
`era_new.py:25-31, 114-116`.

## Instructions

After resolving the destination path, wrap a `relative_to()` call in try/except and
raise ValueError with a clear message on failure. Add containment test.
