<h1 align="center">Anchor - The IDE for Intent</h1>
<p align="center">
Persistent memory of decisions, specs, and architectural constraints across sessions.
It captures what you're building and why - automatically, as you work - and makes that intent persistent across every agent, every session, every project.

## The real challenge of building with AI agents

Code is becoming cheap to generate - you can regenerate it anytime. What's becoming scarce and valuable is the spec (what you're building and why) and verification (proof that it works). Your job as a developer is no longer writing code. It's steering.

I work plan-first. Every project starts with planning sessions - brainstorming with Claude, making architecture decisions, locking in constraints. The spec emerges from the conversation, not from a PRD handed down from above.

The problem is that nothing captures what happens in those sessions. Decisions scatter. Architecture drifts because a constraint from last week is invisible today. You build something and realize three sessions later it contradicts something already agreed on.

**Here's the thing: agents drift. But so do you.** You forget what was decided two weeks ago. You re-propose an approach you already ruled out. The problem isn't just that the agent loses context - it's that the whole development loop loses coherence.

Anchor has already saved me hours. It reminds me of decisions made in other sessions, catches drift, loads sessions with the right context. It gives me confidence to move fast because I know if I forget, Anchor will catch it.

### What Anchor does

1. **Captures specs as you build** - decisions, rules, tradeoffs, lineage - without you having to write them down
2. **Validates decisions across sessions** - flags when a new session contradicts something already established
3. **Verifies implementation** - because Anchor holds the spec, it naturally becomes the verification layer. Not "does this code look right" but "does this code do what we said it should do"

## Who is this for
Anchor is for builders who are primarily building software using AI agents. If you're spending more time steering agents than writing code. Anchor is built for you.


## How It Works

Anchor maintains a **canonical spec** for your product — a structured JSON record of what was decided, what must never be violated, and what tradeoffs were accepted. Four roles work together across your sessions:

| Role | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | Session start | Loads relevant specs into agent context |
| **Historian** | Every agent response | Extracts decisions, surfaces conflicts in real time |
| **Pair Partner** | Every file write | Tracks structural changes, flags boundary crossings |
| **Validator** | Every file write | Checks code against non-negotiables |

All of this runs in a **companion sidebar** — a separate terminal window that watches your Claude Code session and provides continuous feedback.

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add nraychaudhuri/anchor

# Install the plugin
/plugin install anchor@nraychaudhuri-anchor
```

> **Note:** After installing, restart your Claude Code session. `/reload-plugins` loads hooks but skills require a restart to appear.

For development:
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/anchor
```

### First-time setup

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap the canonical spec (run once per product)
/anchor:seed

# 2. Start the companion for each session
/anchor:companion
```

The first time the companion sidebar starts, it will run `claude setup-token` interactively in the companion terminal to generate an OAuth token. This uses your existing Claude subscription — no extra API costs. The token is saved to `~/.anchor/auth.json` and reused automatically.

## The Three Skills

### `/anchor:pairmode` — Structured build methodology (for teams and self-directed builders)

A complete builder/reviewer workflow that any project can adopt. Pairmode turns Claude Code into a disciplined pair — specifications are written first, builders implement against them, and reviewers enforce acceptance criteria at every commit.

```bash
# Bootstrap a new project with the pairmode scaffold
/anchor:pairmode bootstrap

# Audit how far a project has drifted from canonical templates
/anchor:pairmode audit

# Apply upstream methodology updates (with per-change confirmation prompts)
/anchor:pairmode sync

# Capture a methodology insight as a lesson
/anchor:pairmode lesson

# Review accumulated lessons and update templates
/anchor:pairmode review
```

The scaffold produces: `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.build.md`, `docs/` (brief, architecture, phases, CER backlog), `.claude/agents/` (builder, reviewer, loop-breaker, security-auditor, intent-reviewer), and `.claude/settings.json` with a spec-derived deny list.

Phases are tracked individually in `docs/phases/phase-N.md`. A CER triage backlog (`docs/cer/backlog.md`) captures findings that cannot be resolved immediately.

---

### `/anchor:seed` — Bootstrap (run once)

Reads your entire codebase and all historical Claude Code sessions to build the canonical spec from scratch:

1. **Setup** — Product name, repos, spec location
2. **Module discovery** — Identifies 5-15 major modules from your codebase
3. **Spec writing** — Parallel agents analyze each module
4. **Session mining** — Extracts decisions from all past Claude Code transcripts
5. **Reconcile** — Merges everything into canonical `spec.json` files with full lineage

### `/anchor:companion` — Start session (run every time)

1. **Module selection** — Asks what you're working on (with git-based suggestions)
2. **Recovery check** — Detects unreconciled sessions from previous runs
3. **Spec loading** — Reads `spec.json` for selected modules into agent context
4. **Sidebar launch** — Opens the companion in a new terminal window

## The Canonical Spec

Each module has one `spec.json`:

```json
{
  "module": "auth-and-security",
  "summary": "JWT, OAuth, MFA, rate limiting. All API access requires authentication.",
  "business_rules": [
    "All API endpoints except /public require a valid JWT",
    "JWT must include company_id for multi-tenant routing"
  ],
  "non_negotiables": [
    "Auth must never call billing directly — events only",
    "Google refresh tokens must be stored encrypted, never plaintext"
  ],
  "tradeoffs": [
    {
      "decision": "HS256 over RS256 for JWT signing",
      "reason": "Simpler at current scale",
      "accepted_cost": "Cannot verify tokens without the shared secret"
    }
  ],
  "conflicts": [],
  "lineage": [
    {
      "session_id": "8fdc6432-...",
      "summary": "Auth design session — JWT structure and MFA",
      "date": "2026-03-15",
      "resume": "claude --resume 8fdc6432-..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Design principles:**
- **JSON not markdown** — programs can update it without parsing
- **Summary is always rewritten** — stays current with each reconcile
- **Lineage is append-only** — full audit trail with `claude --resume` links
- **Non-negotiables never auto-resolve** — always require a developer decision

## The Companion Sidebar

A persistent terminal window that watches your Claude Code session:

### What you see

- **Specs panel** — loaded modules with key points (non-negotiables) always visible
- **Extraction results** — decisions, rules, tradeoffs captured from each conversation turn
- **Live chart** — module sequence diagram showing which modules are being touched
- **Conflict alerts** — when something violates a non-negotiable

### Conflict actions

When a conflict is detected:

- **`s`** — Snooze (dismiss, you're aware)
- **`r`** — Record (save to `conflicts_pending.json` with optional note)
- **`o`** — Override (requires a reason, updates the spec, archives the old rule)

## Hook Architecture

All hooks are thin relays — no API calls, exit in milliseconds. The sidebar does all heavy work asynchronously.

| Hook | Trigger | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stop.py` | After each agent response | Historian | Relay to sidebar for incremental extraction |
| `exit_plan_mode.py` | Plan approved | — | Persist captures, relay plan content to sidebar |
| `post_tool_use.py` | File written/edited | Pair Partner | File change to sidebar for module tracking |
| `session_end.py` | Session closes | — | Signal sidebar to show summary and exit |

## Data Flow

```
Planning conversation
    ↓
Stop hook → sidebar → LLM extraction → captures displayed
    ↓
persist_capture() → incremental.json (saved immediately, per capture)
    ↓
Plan file written → sidebar detects it → impact analysis (adds/modifies/conflicts)
    ↓
Session ends → sidebar shows session summary + exits cleanly
    ↓
Next /anchor:companion → detects unreconciled sessions → reconciles into spec.json
```

No data loss at any point. Captures are saved to disk immediately — if the session crashes, everything up to the last capture is preserved. Reconcile runs on the next companion startup, not at session end.
